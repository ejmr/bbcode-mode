BBCode Mode
===========

This project adds support for writing [Bulletin Board Code][bbc] in
[GNU Emacs][emacs].  To use the mode all you need to do is place the
file in your `load-path` and then add `(require 'bbcode-mode)` to your
Emacs configuration file.

BBCode mode is still a work in progress.  When sending bug reports
please include the value of `bbcode-mode-version-number` and, if you
have cloned the official Git repository, the commit hash of the
version you are using.
